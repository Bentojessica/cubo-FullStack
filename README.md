### Front-end

The following layout should be developed
![layout](layout-onepage.png)

[You can download the PSD here](layout-onepage.psd)

- You can use the libs and frameworks that make you more comfortable;
- All fields are required in the form;
- We'll be happy if you develop tests for it;

### Back-end

The layout has a form, a table with percentage information of participation and a pizza graph that represents this distribution.

- You need to create APIs that sends and receives these informations;
- We'll be happy if you develop tests for it;
- In case of inconsistency, return the error in a structured JSON with HTTP 400 code;
